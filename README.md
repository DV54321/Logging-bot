# Logging-bot
This is a simple bot written in Eris that will log every message to the console.
# What you would need
- node.js
https://nodejs.org/en/
- A bot account
https://discord.com/developers/applications
- Git (not required but it would help a lot)
# How do set up the bot
once node.js is installed, either download the bot's files or if you're using git, type git clone https://github.com/DV54321/Logging-bot.git

# Step 2
in the bot.js file, on line 2, where it says 
const bot = new Eris('Bot Token')
replace bot token (keep the single quotes though) with your discord bot token

# Step 3
in command prompt, type npm install

# Step 4
once everything is installed, type node bot in the same console, and you should get something like this on start up.
